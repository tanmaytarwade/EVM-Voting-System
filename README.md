The EVM Voting system  project is designed to facilitate a web-based voting system, enabling users to vote for candidates and manage voting processes efficiently.
Key Components:
Spring Framework
Spring Framework provides the core functionalities used in the project:

Dependency Injection (DI):

Automatically manages dependencies between components using annotations like @Autowired.
Spring Data JPA:

Simplifies data access and CRUD operations with repository interfaces like CandidateRepo.java and CitizenRepo.java.
Spring Boot
Spring Boot streamlines the creation and deployment of the application:

Auto-configuration:

Automatically configures Spring components based on included dependencies, reducing boilerplate code.
Embedded Server:

Includes an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat) that allows the application to run independently.
Starter Dependencies:

Bundles common libraries for specific functionalities, simplifying dependency management (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web for web applications).

Conclusion
The EVM Voting system  project is a comprehensive solution for managing an online voting system. It leverages the power of Spring Boot to provide a robust backend, while the front-end templates ensure a smooth user experience. The project is designed with scalability, security, and efficiency in mind, making it a valuable tool for any organization looking to implement a reliable and accessible voting system.

This system not only simplifies the voting process but also enhances its integrity and reliability, ensuring that each vote is properly accounted for and that the overall process is transparent and trustworthy.
